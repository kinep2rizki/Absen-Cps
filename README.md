So, In this repo. I was working for CPS Laboratory to make an Attendance Device using RFID, LCD and ESP-8266.
The principle of this code is, first you make a database and store the rfid card ID there
the Database would get split by real time and firestore.
the data of the ID would be saved in Firestore.
The real time would be connected to the esp to save the check in,check out, value of the id and time stamp
and the ID that have been tapped in and out, would not be able to check in again

thats it for now, thankss
